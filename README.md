# Mod Template (Quilt)  
MCLegoMan's mod template for Minecraft mods using Quilt Loader.

## Recommendations 
If you are just after a template to make your mods,
I would suggest using the official [Quilt Template Mod](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-template-mod).  
I suggest this as the official template is licensed under `CC0`,
unlike this one which is under `LGPL-v3-or-later`, and you will get more support when using the official template.

## Usage  
1. Create a new repository using the [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=Mod-Template&template_owner=MCLegoMan) button at the top of this page.  
2. Clone the above-mentioned repository to your computer.  
3. Make any required changes to suit your mod:  
   - Update `gradle.properties` with your mod name, maven group, and update any versioning if required.  
   - Update `quilt.mod.json` to use your mod's metadata.  
4. Update the names of folders, classes, etc, to reflect your mod.  
5. You're ready to get started!  

## Credits  
- [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod)
  - This template was built on top of the Fabric Example Mod, adjusted to use Quilt Loader, along with my file structuring.  
- [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org/)   
  - This template is for the Quilt Loader, and thus wouldn't be possible without them!  

## License  
As mentioned above, this template is licensed under `LGPL-v3-or-later`.
This is because all of my mods are licensed under this licence,
and so it makes it easier for me to have the template already have the licence information.
